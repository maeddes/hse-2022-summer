* Spring Data
* Concept of entities and repositories
* JPA, SQL and JDBC basics
* H2 as in-memory database backend

=== Objectives and exercises
_The student is able to build a Spring Boot application (or extend an existing one) with Spring Data configuration. The exercise is to create an application, which performs CRUD operations on a database backend. The database can either be in-memory (H2) or a (containerized) PostgreSQL (soon :-))._

=== Student Questions:

* How can you return different HTTP status codes depending on the result of your invocation?

=== Lab tasks:

* Add Sping Data JPA to your application, use H2 as database driver/implementation in the first place
* Extend the data object with @Entity annotation AND define an id
* Build a repository interface based on Crud/JPARepository
* Autowire the repository to your application / Controller class
* Invoke "database actions"

== (04/11) Lookout: Idea/Big picture of lab task

* Provide interchangeable frontend and backend components for UI and business logic
* Any frontend needs to be able to talk with any backend
* Any backend needs to expose the same API and interact with the same database

== (04/18) No lecture (Easter Monday)

== (04/25) Introduction to containers and docker

* What are containers and how do they work
* Containers vs. VMs 
* History of containers and rise of Docker
* Docker concepts: daemon, hub, dockerfile, CLI
* Running containers with various options

image::pics//docker.png[]

=== Objectives and exercises
_The student understands the concepts and use cases of container technology and is able to describe them. The first exercise is to pull sample images from an image registry (e.g. Docker Hub) and interact with them (run, expose port, execute shell, cleanup etc). After that the student can show how to build a custom image via Dockerfile and push it to a registry for others to access. Complete the exercises handed out via URL._

== (05/02) Alternatives to REST - Guest lecturer Lars

=== Talk abstract
_REST is the most popular web API technology used these days. It is well supported by programming languages, frameworks and all kind of monitoring tools as well as understood by many developers. It is therefore often the first choice when having to implement a web API for any kind of backend. But there are limitations and use cases where - APIâ€™s do not fit that well. Luckily, there are a few interesting alternatives available these days. GraphQL is one such alternative so are gRPC and RSocket. In this talk I will introduce these technologies, explain their pros and cons compared to -, talk about their maturity and how they are supported by Spring and Spring Boot. I will show code examples and a live demo._

=== Objectives and exercises
_The student understands there are more communication options between two peers than only REST which we have covered before. It's not necessary to know implementation details, but at least awareness of their existence._

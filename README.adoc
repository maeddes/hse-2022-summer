== (03/21) Module: Cloud Introduction (theory-block I)

=== Intro questions:

* Which technologies or what do you have in mind in general if you think about "distributed systems"?
* the "WHY" - Why would people use and implement a distributed systems architecture?

image::pics/brainstorm.png[Initial Brainstorm Session]

=== Content

* What is Cloud Computing? Encounters in everyday life and history
* Characteristic, advantages & challenges
* Terminology - public, private, hybrid, dedicated
* Abstraction layers - IaaS, PaaS, FaaS, SaaS
* Overview - Hypervisors, virtual machines, containers and orchestration
* Overview - Global cloud service providers (CSPs), technologies and corresponding offerings

=== Objectives and exercises
_The student is able to describe cloud computing in own words and list examples for offerings, topologies and technologies. Includes ability to differentiate between different abstraction layers and knowledge how those layers and according technologies interact with each other. No exercises in this module_

=== Links:

* https://landscape.cncf.io/
* https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-145/final

=== Review questions

* What modern, current technologies relate to the topic of distributed computing. List 3 and explain why.
* Describe 3 abstraction layers of cloud (incl. abbreviation) and list a technology example for each.
* What characteristics and features can I expect as a service consumer from the various layers.
* List pros and cons for cloud (generic) - X examples each

=== Lab tasks:

* Get a (public) git provider (github, gitlab, internal gitlab of HSE ...)
* Get a Java-compatible IDE (VS Code, Intellij Idea, gitpod, Eclipse ...)
* Get a docker id
* Recommended: Local Docker/Container environment (Docker for Windows/Mac, Rancher Desktop)

== (03/28) Module: Spring Boot and REST API Intro

== Module: Spring Boot Introduction

* Background: Spring Framework - History & components
* Spring <- -> Spring Boot
* Spring Initializr (start.spring.io) & starter dependencies
* Basic project structure (folders, configuration ..)
* "Hello, World!" example explained
* Using Actuator

image::pics/spring_boot_intro.png[Spring Boot High Level concepts]

=== Objectives
_The student is able to build and configure an own Spring Boot application from scratch with the IDE of choice. The exercise is to build an own "Hello, World!" application that exposes various REST endpoints and is able to execute CRUD operations on the state of the application. Optional: Add logging and testing, configure Actuator._

* https://www.baeldung.com/spring-rest-openapi-documentation
* https://www.baeldung.com/spring-pathvariable

=== Lab tasks:

* Build your own Spring Boot application starting at the Spring Initializr (start.spring.io)
* Add the following dependencies: Spring Web, Actuator, DevTools
* Run the microservice and test the endpoint /actuator/health and /actuator/info
* Annotate the Microservice with @RestController and implement a "Hello, World!" method, which responds to an HTTP GET request.
* Add some basic "functionality" to make the service react to HTTP GET, POST calls (e.g. modify an internal list). Optional: PUT and DELETE
* Change the server port to 8090
* Add the Swagger UI as described in the Baeldung tutorial
* Add an echo endpoint that returns a given parameter using the @PathVariable annotation

== (04/03) Module: Spring Boot Recap and REST

image::pics/rest_api_simple.png[REST API concepts]

* Synchronous communication
* HTTP and REST
* Verbs, Resources, Nouns
* Evolution, Richardson Maturity Model
* CRUD Operations
* Building a REST API with Spring (Boot)
* Building a data model with REST

=== Links:

* https://restfulapi.net/idempotent-rest-apis/
* https://restfulapi.net/richardson-maturity-model/
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

=== Student Question:

* Identification of an item (or a resource on general on the server side)? What is the identifier?
* Which client do I use if I want to do anything else than a GET call? Clients: Postman, curl
* Feedback to client for successful or non-successful execution?
** HTTP Status codes
** Return type: Return created or modified object, nothing if deleted successfully
* How does the code determine which status code to respond with

=== Lab tasks:

* Build your own data model. Start with a simple Java class (e.g. Shopping Item, Todolist Item, Person Info)
* Build a REST API using a verbs and nouns to
** Create item entries
** List item entries
** Delete item entries
** Update item entries
* Use JSON as exchange mechanism

image::pics/data_api.png[CRUD Operatios without a database]

== (04/11) Module: REST Recap, Persistence and UI

* Repeat REST API concepts & HTTP status codes
* Spring Data
* Concept of entities and repositories
* JPA, SQL and JDBC basics
* H2 as in-memory database backend

=== Objectives and exercises
_The student is able to build a Spring Boot application (or extend an existing one) with Spring Data configuration. The exercise is to create an application, which performs CRUD operations on a database backend. The database can either be in-memory (H2) or a (containerized) PostgreSQL (soon :-)).

* https://www.baeldung.com/spring-data-derived-queries
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.0.x/reference/html/howto-database-initialization.html

=== Student Questions:

* How can you return different HTTP status codes depending on the result of your invocation?

=== Lab tasks:

* Add Sping Data JPA to your application, use H2 as database driver/implementation in the first place
* Extend the data object with @Entity annotation AND define an id
* Build a repository interface based on Crud/JPARepository
* Autowire the repository to your application / Controller class
* Invoke "database actions"

== (04/11) Lookout: Idea/Big picture of lab task

* Provide interchangeable frontend and backend components for UI and business logic
* Any frontend needs to be able to talk with any backend
* Any backend needs to expose the same API and interact with the same database
